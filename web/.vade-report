## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

1. **Package Installation**
   - Installed `@vercel/analytics` package version 1.6.1 using npm
   - Updated package.json to include the new dependency
   - Updated package-lock.json with all required dependencies

2. **Code Integration**
   - Modified `app/layout.tsx` to integrate Vercel Analytics:
     - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
     - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
   - Preserved all existing code structure, styling, and functionality

3. **Verification**
   - Build completed successfully with no errors
   - TypeScript compilation passed without issues
   - No new linting errors were introduced (existing linting errors in other files are pre-existing and unrelated to this change)
   - All routes generated successfully: /, /about, /results, /wizard, and /_not-found

### Implementation Details:

The Analytics component was placed at the end of the body tag as recommended by Vercel's best practices. This ensures:
- Analytics tracking is initialized after the main content loads
- No impact on initial page render performance
- Proper tracking of all user interactions across all pages

### Files Modified:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package dependencies

The implementation follows Next.js App Router conventions and Vercel Analytics documentation. Analytics will now track page views and Web Vitals automatically when the application is deployed to Vercel.
